				My name is Elon Musk. I am a student from IAMSMART School. I was born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. I am quite a smart person in the class and always get a grade of at least 5th place of the whole grade. My favorite subjects are computer science, physics and chemistry. I have been doing computer programming since when I was at 10 and sold a video game at the age of 12. I want to attend university to better understand and study about physics, chemistry and computer science as I hope to be a technology engineer.
